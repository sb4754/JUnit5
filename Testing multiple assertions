@Test
void groupedAssertions() {
    Address address = new Address();
    assertAll("address name",
        () -> assertEquals("John", address.getFirstName()),
        () -> assertEquals("User", address.getLastName())
    );
}




If these tests fail, the result looks like the following:

=> org.opentest4j.MultipleFailuresError: address name (2 failures)
expected: <John> but was: <null>
expected: <User> but was: <null>
